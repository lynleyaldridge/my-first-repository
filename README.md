# my-first-repository

**Hello, world** - as the convention goes.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I'm grateful for all the helpful resources I've found online to get me to this point.

[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) has held my hand through the initial stages of the process of making my account, installing and configuring Git, creating my first repository, cloning it onto my desktop, using the Git Bash shell to amend this file, and pushing a commit to the repository from my local computer.

Now I've edited this file using my brower, and I'm going to commit these changes before progressing to the next steps ...

And now, I'm editing this file directly in RStudio!!

Being able to use the RMarkdown syntax I've recently begun using to format this README.md file feels good!  

And this 'preview changes' option looks like track changes, but better.
