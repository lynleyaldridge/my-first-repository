# my-first-repository

**Hello, world** - as the convention goes.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I'm grateful for all the helpful resources I've found online to get me to this point.

[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) has held my hand through all the following stages of the installation process:
* making my GitHub account
* installing and configuring Git
* creating my first repository
* cloning it onto my desktop
* using the Git Bash shell to amend the README file, and push a commit to the repository from my local computer
* using RStudio to clone a repository to my desktop, amend the README file, and push a commit to the repository  

I did like being able to use the RMarkdown syntax I've recently begun using to format this README.md file, in that I felt like I wasn't starting from scratch completely here!  

And I was impressed by the 'preview changes' view, showing the changes I've made to this document before I commit them.  Like track changes in word, but better.

I'm keeping this repository online primarily for testing purposes.
