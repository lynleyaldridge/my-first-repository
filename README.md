# my-first-repository

**Hello, world** - as the convention goes.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I'm grateful for all the helpful resources I've found online to get me to this point.

[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) has held my hand through the initial stages of the process of making my account, installing and configuring Git, and I'm now working through [a resource from datacarpentry.org](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/02-git-in-github/index.html) to get my head around GitHub repositeries, how to clone them to my desktop, how to edit using R Studio, and how to create a pull request to update the online repository.  At least, that's how I imagine the process is going to work?

Being able to use RMarkdown syntax to format the README.md file is handy.
