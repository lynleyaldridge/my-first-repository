# my-first-repository

**Hello, world** - as the convention goes.

This is my first ever GitHub project and I'm grateful for all the helpful resources I've found online to get me to this point.

[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) has held my hand through all the following stages of the installation process:
* making my GitHub account
* installing and configuring Git
* creating my first repository
* cloning it onto my desktop
* using the Git Bash shell to amend the README file, and push a commit to the repository from my local computer
* using RStudio to clone a repository to my desktop, amend the README file, and push a commit to the repository  

Being able to use the RMarkdown syntax I've recently begun using to format this README.md file feels good!  

And this 'preview changes' option looks like track changes, but better.
